PoC for metamorphic relation generation using brute-force approach

Sample implementation of Metamorphic Relation generation for pow(x,e) function. The main goal of this code is to show the underlying logic of the approach for metamorphic relation generation for mathematical functions, and to show the importance of good entry data and initial MRs to reduce the problem space in real-life scenarios.
